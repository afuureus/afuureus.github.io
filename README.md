# Afuu's Idola Stat Tool

Here's a simulator that I created that allows you to effectively build teams in the game Idola: Phantasy Star Saga.

 - Thank you to PS Fleet and Azelyra's Community Discord for testing the tool and providing feedback.

## How to Use
  1. Select the characters via the drop down menu to start.
  2. Beside the character name is a drop down menu for the current limit break value of the character.
  3. Enter in the bonus stats from your Weapon Symbol, Soul Symbol, Mag respectively.
  4. In the fourth box (bottom right), enter in a whole number value of the total amount of buffs applied to the respective stats.
     (EG; Gerda soul is entered as 25)
  5. Hit the Refresh Stats button.
